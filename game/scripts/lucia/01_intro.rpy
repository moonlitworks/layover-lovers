  dj "...Aaand we're back!"
  dj "Thank you for tuning in to RockWave Radio International, the coolest station on the planet!"
  dj "As you all know by now, I'm your favorite rhythm rascal, DJ Sonic Boom, and I think it's about time to turn up the feels to an eleven!"
  dj "Life's just a crazy rollercoaster, isn't it?"
  dj "We meet so many people in our lives, on the train, walking down the street, in a foreign country during a holiday..."
  dj "Sometimes, fate works in strange ways and it might make us bump into our soulmate when we least expect it!"
  dj "That's why I, along with the boys and girls over at RockWave Radio International, thought of this show to hopefully bridge those gaps and let you all have another chance at meeting each other!"
  dj "That's right... it's time for \"Reconnect\"! And, it seems like we have our first caller!"
  dj "Hello, hello, you're on air! Tell us your name and a little bit about yourself. The audience's dying to hear your story!"
  girl "Uh, hello? Hello! Can you hear me?"
  dj "Yeah, we hear you loud and clear! This is RockWave Radio International, and you're on Reconnect!"
  girl "Whew, good! I-I thought I had the wrong number for a moment..."
  girl "I'm [girlName], I'm 26, and I guess I'm an actress now?"
  girl "S-Sorry, I didn't mean to sound so boastful!"
  dj "...An actress? It's the first time an actual celebrity has called our show!"
  girl "H-Haha... I wouldn't call myself a celebrity. "
  girl "I just landed the role, so it's probably gonna take a few years before the movie actually comes out!"
  dj "Oh, gotcha! Still, that's mighty impressive! Is that your first role on the big screen, then?"
  girl "Yes, it is. I was a theater actress before that."
  girl "I moved to Bristelline about a year ago, and ever since then, I've entered all the casting auditions I could find."
  girl "And it seems like I finally got lucky!"
  dj "It seems more than just simple luck. It sounds like you're just naturally talented!"
  girl "I don't know... Whatever it is that happened, I can't take full credit for it. "
  girl "There's this one person that helped me a lot."
  girl "He helped me with finding my true self and propel myself forward. He taught me to keep trying and trying until I got what I truly wanted."
  dj "Sounds like an amazing person, alright! Can you tell us more about him?"
  girl "Well, it's a pretty long story..."
  dj "We've got plenty of time to hear it! But, before you start, could you tell us where you know our show from?"
  girl "It's a weird coincidence, but I first heard it in a coffee shop, as I was spending my time with the man I wanted to tell you about."
  dj "Don't keep us waiting, then! The listeners and I are at the edge of our seats to hear all about him."
  girl "O-Okay, I hope I'll do a good job telling my story!"
  girl "It all started when I took what I thought was a short nap, in the waiting area at an airport..."
