  dj "...Aaand we're back!"
  dj "Thank you for tuning in to RockWave Radio International, the coolest station on the planet!"
  dj "As you all know by now, I'm your favorite rhythm rascal, DJ Sonic Boom, and I think it's about time to turn up the feels to an eleven!"
  dj "Life's just a crazy rollercoaster, isn't it?"
  dj "We meet so many people in our lives, on the train, walking down the street, in a foreign country during a holiday..."
  dj "Sometimes, fate works in strange ways and it might make us bump into our soulmate when we least expect it!"
  dj "That's why I, along with the boys and girls over at RockWave Radio International, thought of this show to hopefully bridge those gaps and let you all have another chance at meeting each other!"
  dj "That's right... it's time for \"Reconnect\"! And, it seems like we have our first caller!"
  dj "Hello, hello, you're on air! Tell us your name and a little bit about yourself. The audience's dying to hear your story!"
  guy "My name's [guyName], I'm 29, and I used to be a chief marketing officer at a large company. Until recently, that is."
  dj "Whoa, [guyName], you sound like quite a big shot! But, wait up... You {i}used{/i} to be a CMO? What happened?"
  dj "Sounds like you landed a dream job and tossed it away, just cause!"
  guy "Ha-ha, well, it's kind of complicated. Let's just say my priorities shifted a bit in recent years, especially after I met someone special."
  guy "You see, I used to live in Bristelline with only work on my mind, but I moved back to my tiny hometown, and ever since then, I've been trying to live my life to the fullest."
  guy "And yeah, it's all thanks to that special someone. She made me learn a thing or two about myself, and that there's more to life than just making money."
  dj "Well, ain't that the truth, brother!"
  dj "Gotta say, though, your story sounds super juicy already! I'm itching to hear it, but before that, can you tell me where you know our show from?"
  guy "It's funny, but I heard it first in a coffee shop, the same day I met the girl I want to tell you about."
  dj "Couldn't be a coincidence, if you ask me!"
  dj "Alright, [guyName], everyone's extremely curious about your story. Myself included! "
  dj "Tell us, how did you manage to meet that girl that can't escape your mind?"
  guy "As fate would have it, it all started during a layover..."
