  "I order my coffee and sit down at one of the empty tables, sipping the hot beverage as I feel my energy returning."
  "It's still pretty early, though I spent all of the morning cramped inside of a plane, with the rest of the day evidently following the same pattern."
  "That's why I need to get some coffee to wake me up."
  "I doubt I'll be able to fall asleep after this, so instead I might stay up and watch a movie or two until it's time to get off the plane."
  "There's this new historical movie that recently came out that seemed pretty interesting. I wonder if they'll have it on the pla-"
  "I feel a tingling sensation on my neck as if an unseen pair of eyes are focused on me."
  "Curious, I turn around and sweep the room with my sight, finding the person in question almost instantly."

  "It's her!"
  "Before I realize that what I'm about to do might be considered impolite, I rise from my chair and walk to her table, hoping to strike up a conversation."
  "She seems a bit skittish, but also elated to see me, as much, if not more, as I am to see her."
  "It'll be great chatting with her for a bit now that her panic is gone."
  guy "What a coincidence, us bumping into each other once again!"
  girl blush "Y-Yeah, tell me about it! I was almost sure that you took your plane and were on your way already."
  guy "I still have a few short hours before that... I imagine you do, too? Seeing as you're still here."
  girl smile "That's right. They managed to find a substitute flight for me, and I don't even have to wait until tomorrow!"
  girl "...Though it's not instant, either."
  girl "I have almost five hours until then. T-That's why I'm sitting here, in this coffee shop, wishing for the time to go by faster."
  guy "Well, maybe I could help you pass the time? It always goes quicker if you occupy yourself with a nice conversation!"
  girl blush "S-Sure thing! I can also use it as an opportunity to thank you for what you did earlier."
  girl curious "Speaking of which... Do you like croissants?"
  guy "Is that even a question? I love them!"

  "[girlName] chuckles at my enthusiasm, before offering me to sit down as she takes a quick trip to the counter."

  "I do as she says, taking a seat on the chair opposite where she was sitting before she comes back with a tray full of steaming pastries."

  girl "They came straight out of the oven, so they might be a bit hot!"
  guy " You know, I wasn't feeling hungry, but I don't think I'll be able to say no to those croissants!"
  girl grin "Ha-ha... Good! Eat as many as you want. It's my treat for having helped a damsel in distress!"
